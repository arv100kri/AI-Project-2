"Societal needs could be more clear"
"Not really convinced more work needs to be done"

Changes
--------
Re-wrote the entire problem statement to narrow the focus of our project but also explain how our work is part of a larger problem (with significant
societal impact) that appears not to be addressed by existing literature. Clarified what we are doing, why we are doing it and why we think it is significant.

Description of what you will implement (1)

Comments

"Why does your approach make sense"

Changes
--------
Since our work cannot leverage any high-level linguistic feature, our
approach of a temporal segmentation technique is a good starting point and
hence makes sense. We have elaborated this point in this section.

"What will your user study be compared against"
"What is the scoring scale"

Changes

Picked a paper with which to compare results. Also, we succinctly described the user study and clearly mentioned our basis for evaluation (percentage of gestures correctly identified).
