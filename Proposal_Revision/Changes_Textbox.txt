Problem addressed and its importance (1)

Comments

"Societal needs could be more clear"
"Not really convinced more work needs to be done"

Changes
--------
Re-worded the entire problem statement to reflect 
some of the broad societal impact that a solution to our problem
may have. Added clear detail to what we are doing, why we are doing 
it and why we think it is significant.

"How are/ where are your references deficient"

Changes

Description of what you will implement (1)
----------------------------------------------
Comments
--------
"Why does your approach make sense"

Changes
--------
Since our work cannot leverage any high-level liguistic feature, our
approach of a temporal segmentation technique is a good starting and
hence makes sense. We have elaborated on this point in this section 
of the revised proposal.


Description of how you will evaluate the results (0.5)
---------------------------------------------------------
Comments
--------
"What are you comaparing against"
"What will your user study be compared against"
"What is the scoring scale"

Changes
--------
Mentioned the established results (and its paper) against which we
will compare our results. Made the description of the user study
more concise and clearly mentioned what is our parameter for 
evaluation (number of gestures correctly identified)
